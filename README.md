1)IOT enabled Weather Station using ESP32(ClimaTrack)
IOT weather station is a model device that is used to send the local weather data to the cloud and locally display the temperature and weather. Each of this model device can be placed in different location to collect local weather data and push to cloud. The cloud data can also be retrieved later for reports and analysis.

To Do:
-Improve robustness on certain sensor failure cases.
-Managing Data in Firebase.
-OTA Firmware Updates.

2)TTS-Service using Google Api
Tried to replicate typical TTS using ESP32 by querying an API. Need Improvements on reducing output noise.
